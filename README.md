# CartStore

**CartStore** is a simple online grocery store application that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, manage their profile, and proceed to checkout. The project is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with data being stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in using their email and password.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profile information, including name, email, address, and contact number.
- **Product Listing**: Display a list of products with the ability to add them to the cart.
- **Cart Management**: Users can view the items in their cart, remove items, and see the total cost.
- **Checkout**: A simple checkout process that confirms the order.
- **Logout**: Users can log out, which clears their session and cart data from `localStorage`.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The homepage where users are greeted and can browse products.
- `login.html`: The login page for user authentication.
- `register.html`: The registration page for new users.
- `profile.html`: The page where users can view and update their profile information.
- `cart.html`: The cart page that displays all items added by the user and allows them to proceed to checkout.
